# Sentiment-analysis-project
Sentiment analysis project for the course of Natural Language Understanding.
There are two files:

- "exploratory.ipynb" contains the code for exploring the dataset to see how it is composed and some of the statistics are extracted.
- "project.ipynb" contains the pre-processing pipelines, the models and all the code that is necessary to train and test the models. Traing and testing of the models are also performed there.
